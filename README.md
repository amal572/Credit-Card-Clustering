![Header](header_cc.png)
The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables. You need to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy from the dataset.

# Objective

There are a lot of features in this dataset (18 behavioral features). We will now perform:

* Data preprocessing
* Feature extraction using PCA to reduce the dimensionality to improve clustering
* Experiment with various clustering models: KMeans, Agglomerative Hierarchical, Gaussian Mixture
* Choosing the number of clusters
* EDA to segment the customers
